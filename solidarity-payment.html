  <h1>WE ARE ASKING FOR A SOLIDARITY PAYMENT</h1>
  <p>Under this model of solidarity payments we are not selling you a product. We are selling you our labour, our time. You get to decide what our hourly wage should be.
<br><br>For this tulip ice cream we have received a fair fee from Kunstverein, following the kunstenaarshonorarium. So they have already bought the ice cream. We are re-selling on their behalf, following the same principle. All solidarity payments will go directly to Kunstverein to support their ongoing projects and programme.
    </p>

<p>What wage* do you want to give to us? You should base this on your own wage. Meaning that if you earn €13.27** an hour, then you can pay us an hourly wage of €13.27. But if you earn €80 an hour, then you can pay us an hourly wage of €80.<br><br>We've made a wage calculator to help you calculate the solidarity payment:</p>

<div id="paymentbox"><p class="paymenttext">The wage you will give us: <br> €<span id="wage" contenteditable="true">...</span>/hr</p>
  <p class="paymenttext">1 tub = 15 mins = €<span id="onetub">...</span> <br> 2 tubs = 30 mins = €<span id="twotub">...</span> <br> 3 tubs = 45 mins = €<span id="threetub">...</span> <br> <span id="xtubs" contenteditable>?</span> tubs = <span id="tubmins"> ?</span> mins = € <span id="xtub">...</span> <br></p>

<p>*The government <s>advises that</s> is debating a law for freelancers (which artists are) <s>should also</s> to charge charge a bruto minimum wage of <s>€16/hour</s> €32.24. This is intended to cover insurances, holiday, sick pay, etc.
<br>** €13.27 is the minimum hourly wage of a person on a 0-hours contract in The Netherlands.<br></p>

  We learnt about solidarity payments through Tialda van der Wal & Freyja Haddrill-Selman’s documentary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mKjggqKBdg"><i>‘Valuing the work of farmers: building solidarity in our communities’</i></a> which looked at farmers who had adopted a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) model in The Netherlands. The film concerned the unsustainable labour of farmers, who worked using ethical and environmentally conscious methods. Solidarity payments allowed these farmers to earn at least the minimum wage – without it they were earning as little as €5/h as freelancers. Solidarity payments resonated with us, we’d been struggling with how to offer our ice cream when really what we were wanting to offer was an object (in the form of an ice cream tub) that allowed us to discuss the network of producers and growers we had mapped in our local area, and try to address some of the problems that faced their livelihoods. People kept expecting supermarket prices, which did not reflect our time, what we had made, or how we had tried to make it.
<br><br>
A solidarity model does not have customers, it has shareholders. A share is equivalent to an hour of work put in by the producer. All of the company costs (rent, material costs, equipment, repairs, administration, insurance, pension contributions, holiday pay etc.), are also divided amongst all the shares. The shareholders each contribute according to their own hourly incomes, and in proportion to their projected shares. The logic is a theory of labour: without the injection of human labour, none of it would happen. Ideally you subscribe and buy your shares in advance, assuming the risk of growing food or making an ethical product, without chemicals, without artificial and harmful intervention, with the producer.
<br><br>
Solidarity payments offer solidarity because they contribute to a decent, living wage. It’s in solidarity with society, because everyone will have access to sustainable food and products, regardless of their income. It’s also in solidarity with our environment, surrounding ecosystems and biodiversity. Solidarity fosters food sovereignty. You can’t produce sustainably if you can’t cover the costs.
<br><br>
The idea of solidarity payments exist in different industries, including in football, and is explored for the agricultural sector by Elske Hageraats in her book <a href="https://toekomstboeren.nl/eerlijkloon/"><i>‘Eerlijk Loon. Solidaire betaling en andere boereninitiatieven’.</i></a> We encourage you to buy a copy!
