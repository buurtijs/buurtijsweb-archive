  <h1>WE ARE ASKING FOR A SOLIDARITY PAYMENT</h1>
  <p>Under a solidarity model, we do not sell you a product but instead sell you our labour, our work, our time. You get to decide what our hourly wage should be.</p>
  <p>WHAT IS A SOLIDARITY PAYMENT?</p>
  <p>Our transparent budget.</p>

  <p>What wage do you want to give to us? This should be based on your own wage. So if you are a freelancer and you earn €5 an hour, then you can pay us that. But if you earn €80 an hour, then you can pay us that.</p>
  <p> The wage you will give us: <br> €<span id="wage" contenteditable="true">...</span>/hr</p>
  <p>1 tub = 15 mins = €<span id="onetub">...</span> <br> 2 tubs = 30 mins = €<span id="twotub">...</span> <br> 3 tubs = 45 mins = €<span id="threetub">...</span> <br> <span id="xtubs" contenteditable>x</span> tubs = <span id="tubmins"> x</span> mins = €<span id=xtub>...</span> <br></p>
