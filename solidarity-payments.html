  <h1>WE ARE ASKING FOR A SOLIDARITY PAYMENT</h1>
  <p>Under a solidarity model, we do not sell you a product but instead sell you our labour, our work, our time. What wage do you want to give to us? This should be based on your own wage. So if you are a freelancer and you earn €5 an hour, then you can pay us that. But if you earn €80 an hour, then you can pay us that.</p>
