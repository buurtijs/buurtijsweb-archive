  <h1>WHAT IS A SOLIDARITY PAYMENT?</h1>
  <p>
We learnt about solidarity payments when we were watching a documentary by Tialda van der Wal & Freyja Haddrill-Selman called ‘Valuing the work of farmers: building solidarity in our communities’ which looked at a few farmers who adopted a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) model in The Netherlands. The film talked about about the unsustainable income of farmers, and the work that they put into producing something everyone needs (food), who worked using ethical and environmentally conscious methods that are less economical though they are better for the environment. Solidarity payments allowed these farmers to earn at least (and even above) the minimum wage – without it they were earning around €5/h as freelancers.
<br>
The idea of solidarity payments exist in different industries, and is explored for the agricultural sector by Elske Hageraats in her book ‘Eerlijk Loon. Solidaire betaling en andere boereninitiatieven’.
<br>
In essence it is quite simple. A CSA farm does not have customers, it has shareholders. Each one of these shareholders buys a part of the produce, in advance (kind of like playing futures in the stock market). The farmer is the labourer, and CEO, COO, CFO and all the rest. All of the company costs (rent, material costs, equipment, repairs, and the costs of your own (administration, insurance, pension contributions, holiday pay), and divides that amongst the shares, which are divided up into the units of hours invested by the farmer. The logic is quite simple labour theory: without the injection of human labour, none of it would happen. It would just be a collection of items, seeds, tools next to a plot of land (assuming the delivery person delivered it to the plot). This model allows for the risk of growing food, without chemicals, without artificial and harmful intervention, to be taken with the farmer.
<br>
Solidarity payments are solidarity because we get paid a decent, living wage for our labour. It is also solidarity with society, because everyone will have access to food and products, regardless of income. Organic, ethical, considered, handmade food (products) are often perceived as luxury goods - but it should be available to everyone because they protect the environment. We want to produce for everyone! All of our community! This type of payment is solidarity with our future generation too, because if we earn a proper income we can work sustainably, investing in our environment and planet as we do so, and pass that on to others. A product that is as sustainable and as ethical as possible supports farmers and makers working in sustainable and ethical ways, which supports the land and ecosystem, in addition to other species living on that land. Solidarity fosters food sovereignty. You can’t produce sustainably if you can’t cover the costs. </p>
